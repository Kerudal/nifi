    <p>This processor is designed to take any flow file and limit the flow coming through the processor. The limitation is done using the
        key provided for each file using the value given in `KEY`. The configuration of the rate limiter is the same for all passing flow files. 
    </p>
    <p>The Rate Limiter Configuration :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Refill</b> : Creates the Refill that does refill of tokens in intervally manner. "Intervally" in opposite to "greedy" 
            will wait until whole period will be elapsed before regenerate tokens
            <ul>
                <li><b>Token</b> : amount of tokens</li>
                <li><b>Period</b> : the period within tokens will be fully regenerated</li>
            </ul>
                
        </li>
        <li><b>Max Size Bucket</b> : specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain.</li>
        <li><b>Bandwidth Capacity</b> : Specifies limitation in classic interpretation of token-bucket algorithm.</li>
        <li><b>Expire After Write Duration</b> : the maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Cache</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example document:</p>
    <pre>
        {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 22
        }
    </pre>
    <p>The following flow file will use the key, you used to pass through the processor KEY configuration.</p>

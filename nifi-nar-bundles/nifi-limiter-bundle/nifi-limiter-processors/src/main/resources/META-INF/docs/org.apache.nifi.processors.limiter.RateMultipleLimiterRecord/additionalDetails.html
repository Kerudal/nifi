    <p>This processor is designed to take any valid record and limit the flow coming through the processor. In the case of this specific processor, each 
        record coming through can have a specific rate limit configuration. Using a custom configuration allows to take in record from different sources
        and apply their own configuration. In addition, their configuration can change over time. However, if the configuration isn't respecting the
        required format values, the default ones will be used.
        Each record rate limit will be defined by the key used. The key is set using a record path, but if not found the default one will be set as a replacement.
        You can also decide to remove the key, once the record passed through the processor. 
    </p>
    <p>The Rate Multiple Limiter Configuration :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Refill</b> : Creates the Refill that does refill of tokens in intervally manner. "Intervally" in opposite to "greedy" 
            will wait until whole period will be elapsed before regenerate tokens
            <ul>
                <li><b>Token</b> : amount of tokens</li>
                <li><b>Period</b> : the period within tokens will be fully regenerated</li>
            </ul>
                
        </li>
        <li><b>Bandwidth Capacity</b> : Specifies limitation in classic interpretation of token-bucket algorithm.</li>
        <li><b>Expire After Write Duration</b> : the maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Cache</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example document:</p>
    <pre>
        {
            "name": "Bob",
            "age": 22,
            "bucket": {
                "refill_token": 100,
                "refill_period": "10 sec",
                "bandwidth": 1
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>The following record path operations will extract the configuration :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code  class="inlinecode">/bucket/refill_token</code> set for record path(Refill Tokens Record Path), and will have a default value(Refill tokens), and can be removed from the record once used if (Refill Tokens Removed) is set to `true`</li>
        <li><code  class="inlinecode">/bucket/refill_period</code> set for record path(Refill Period Record Path), and will have a default value(Refill period), and can be removed from the record once used if (Refill Period Removed) is set to `true`</li>
        <li><code  class="inlinecode">/bucket/bandwidth</code> set for record path(Bandwidth capacity Record Path), and will have a default value(Bandwidth capacity), and can be removed from the record once used if (Bandwidth capacity Removed) is set to `true`</li>
    </ul>

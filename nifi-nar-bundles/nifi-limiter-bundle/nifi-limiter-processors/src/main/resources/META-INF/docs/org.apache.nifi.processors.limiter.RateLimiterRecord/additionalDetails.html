    <p>This processor is designed to take any valid record and limit the flow coming through the processor. The limitation is done using the
        key provided for each record. The configuration of the rate limiter is the same for all passing records. The key is defined using a record
        path if provided, if not the default value will be used as a replacement. 
    </p>
    <p>The Rate Limiter Configuration :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Refill</b> : Creates the Refill that does refill of tokens in intervally manner. "Intervally" in opposite to "greedy" 
            will wait until whole period will be elapsed before regenerate tokens
            <ul>
                <li><b>Token</b> : amount of tokens</li>
                <li><b>Period</b> : the period within tokens will be fully regenerated</li>
            </ul>
                
        </li>
        <li><b>Max Size Bucket</b> : specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain.</li>
        <li><b>Bandwidth Capacity</b> : Specifies limitation in classic interpretation of token-bucket algorithm.</li>
        <li><b>Expire After Write Duration</b> : the maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Cache</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example document:</p>
    <pre>
        [
            {
                "name": "John",
                "age": 22
            },
            {
                "name": "Bob",
                "age": 32
            },
            {
                "age": 12
            }
        ]
    </pre>
    <p>The following record path operations will extract the configuration :</p>
    <p>The record path <code  class="inlinecode">/name</code> defines the key in this example. However if not specified
     the processor will use the value defined in Key as the default value </p>
